    "content": "### Analysis and Categorization of Support Tickets\n\nBased on the provided support ticket data, the tickets can be categorized into logical groupings based on the product area and the nature of the issues or requests. Here are the identified categories:\n\n#### 1. Talent Acquisition (TA) Issues\n- **Description**: Tickets related to features and functionalities within the Talent Acquisition module, including workflow automation, event management, and candidate management.\n- **Count/Percentage**: 5 out of 9 tickets (55.56%)\n- **Common Keywords or Phrases**: \"workflow automation\", \"Marked as contacted\", \"Disable Register button\", \"Bulk Share Candidates\", \"Only display open communities\"\n\n#### 2. Core Infrastructure (CI) Issues\n- **Description**: Tickets that involve issues related to core infrastructure functionalities like email handling and data management.\n- **Count/Percentage**: 3 out of 9 tickets (33.33%)\n- **Common Keywords or Phrases**: \"CC'ed Emails\", \"emails are going through\", \"Data Lake\"\n\n#### 3. General Support Requests\n- **Description**: Tickets that do not specifically mention a product area or are about general functionality or inquiries.\n- **Count/Percentage**: 1 out of 9 tickets (11.11%)\n- **Common Keywords or Phrases**: \"Bulk Emails\"\n\n### Suggestions for Improvements to Ticket Categorization:\n1. **Standardize Case Type**: Ensure that the 'case_type' field is always filled out to help in quickly identifying the nature of the ticket (e.g., Bug, Feature Request, Inquiry).\n2. **Mandatory Product Area Tagging**: Make it mandatory to specify the 'product_area' for every ticket to streamline the categorization process and ensure tickets are directed to the right team swiftly.\n3. **Utilize Keywords for Automation**: Develop a system to automatically categorize tickets based on common keywords or phrases, which can help in pre-sorting tickets before manual review.\n4. **Resolution Tracking**: Ensure that 'resolution_time' is consistently recorded and utilized for performance tracking and identifying areas where the support process can be improved.\n5. **Feedback Loop**: Implement a system where ticket submitters can tag their tickets with suggested categories, which can then be reviewed and adjusted by support staff. This could lead to faster initial sorting and provide data on how users perceive their issues.\n\nThese improvements can help in enhancing the efficiency of the support team by reducing manual sorting time and improving the accuracy of issue resolution."
