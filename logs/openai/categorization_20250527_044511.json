    "content": "Based on the provided support ticket data, I have categorized the tickets into logical groupings. Here are the identified categories, along with their descriptions, counts, and common keywords or phrases:\n\n### Categories:\n\n1. **Email Issues**\n   - **Description**: Tickets related to problems or questions about email functionalities, including bulk emails and issues with CC'ed emails.\n   - **Count/Percentage**: 3 tickets (33.3%)\n   - **Common Keywords**: \"Bulk Emails\", \"CC'ed Emails\", \"emails are going through\"\n\n2. **Talent Acquisition Features**\n   - **Description**: Tickets that involve features or requests specific to the Talent Acquisition product area, including workflow automations, event management, and candidate sharing.\n   - **Count/Percentage**: 5 tickets (55.6%)\n   - **Common Keywords**: \"workflow automation\", \"Register button\", \"open communities\", \"Bulk Share\", \"drop-down list\"\n\n3. **AI and Data Issues**\n   - **Description**: Tickets concerning inconsistencies or requests related to AI platforms and data management.\n   - **Count/Percentage**: 1 ticket (11.1%)\n   - **Common Keywords**: \"Candidate Match Score\", \"Data Lake\"\n\n### Suggestions for Improvements to Ticket Categorization:\n\n1. **Standardize Case Types**: Ensure that each ticket has a 'case_type' assigned to maintain consistency in ticket processing and reporting. This helps in automated sorting and prioritization.\n\n2. **Enhance Product Area Tagging**: Encourage detailed tagging of the 'product_area' to every ticket. This can help in routing the tickets to the correct department or team faster and more accurately.\n\n3. **Keyword Tagging**: Implement a system where common keywords are tagged automatically or manually when the ticket is created. This can help in quick identification of the issue type and potential clustering of similar issues.\n\n4. **Resolution Tracking**: Make 'resolution_time' a mandatory field to fill upon ticket closure. This will aid in tracking performance metrics and identifying areas where the support process can be improved.\n\n5. **Priority Levels**: Review and possibly revise the priority levels assigned to ensure they truly reflect the urgency and impact of the issue. This can help in prioritizing resources and response times more effectively.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, the support team can enhance their efficiency and effectiveness in handling and resolving support tickets."
