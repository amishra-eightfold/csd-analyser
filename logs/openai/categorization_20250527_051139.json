    "content": "Based on the provided support ticket data, I have categorized the tickets into three main categories. Here's the analysis:\n\n### 1. Category Name: Talent Acquisition Issues\n- **Description**: This category includes tickets related to the Talent Acquisition (TA) product area. Issues range from workflow automation problems to specific feature requests like disabling buttons or enhancing dropdown lists.\n- **Count/Percentage of Tickets**: 5 out of 9 tickets (55.56%)\n- **Common Keywords or Phrases**: \"Talent Acquisition\", \"workflow automation\", \"disable button\", \"drop-down list\", \"Bulk Share\"\n\n### 2. Category Name: Core Infrastructure Issues\n- **Description**: Tickets in this category are associated with the Core Infrastructure (CI) product area. They involve issues with email systems and data handling features.\n- **Count/Percentage of Tickets**: 3 out of 9 tickets (33.33%)\n- **Common Keywords or Phrases**: \"Core Infrastructure\", \"email\", \"Data Lake\", \"CC'ed Emails\", \"vssend.com\"\n\n### 3. Category Name: General Support Requests\n- **Description**: This category includes tickets that do not specifically mention a product area or are related to general support requests like bulk operations or questions about existing functionalities.\n- **Count/Percentage of Tickets**: 1 out of 9 tickets (11.11%)\n- **Common Keywords or Phrases**: \"Bulk Emails\", \"Support Request\"\n\n### Suggestions for Improvements to Ticket Categorization:\n1. **Standardize Case Types**: Ensure that every ticket has a 'case_type' assigned to help in categorizing and prioritizing the issues more efficiently. This field was missing in some tickets.\n2. **Enhance Product Area Tagging**: Some tickets did not have a 'product_area' assigned. Assigning a product area to every ticket could help in routing them to the correct department quickly.\n3. **Use of Tags for Common Issues**: Implement a tagging system for common issues like \"email problems\", \"workflow issues\", or \"feature requests\". This can help in identifying trends and common problems across different product areas.\n4. **Automated Categorization Using AI**: Utilize AI tools to automatically categorize tickets based on keywords and phrases in the subject and description. This can reduce manual categorization errors and improve response time.\n5. **Regular Review and Feedback**: Periodically review the categorization logic based on feedback from the support team to ensure it remains relevant and effective as new products and features are introduced.\n\nThese improvements can help in better management of support tickets, leading to faster resolutions and improved customer satisfaction."
