This will help in sorting and prioritizing tickets more efficiently.\n\n3. **Use of Keywords and Tags**: Encourage the use of specific keywords and tags in the ticket subject and description. This can include specific features, error codes, or common terms that can help in categorizing and routing the tickets more accurately.\n\n4. **Automated Categorization Tools**: Utilize machine learning or rule-based systems to automatically categorize tickets based on their content. This can reduce manual sorting and improve response times.\n\n5. **Regular Review and Feedback**: Periodically review the categorization process and gather feedback from the support team on the challenges and areas for improvement. This will help in continuously refining the categorization process.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the support team can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of handling and resolving support tickets."
