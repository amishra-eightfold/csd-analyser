    "content": "Based on the provided support ticket data, the tickets can be categorized into logical groupings based on common themes, issues, and feature requests. Here are the identified categories:\n\n### 1. Email Management Issues\n**Description:** Tickets related to problems with handling and configuration of emails, including bulk emails and CC'ed emails.\n**Count/Percentage:** 3 tickets (33.3% of total)\n**Common Keywords/Phrases:** \"Bulk Emails\", \"CC'ed Emails\", \"emails are going through\"\n\n### 2. Talent Acquisition Features\n**Description:** Tickets concerning features and functionalities within the Talent Acquisition product area, such as workflow automation, event management, and candidate sharing.\n**Count/Percentage:** 5 tickets (55.6% of total)\n**Common Keywords/Phrases:** \"workflow automation\", \"Disable Register button\", \"Bulk Share Candidates\", \"open communities\"\n\n### 3. AI Platform Issues\n**Description:** Tickets that involve inconsistencies or issues related to the AI platform, specifically around candidate matching.\n**Count/Percentage:** 1 ticket (11.1% of total)\n**Common Keywords/Phrases:** \"Candidate Match Score Inconsistency\"\n\n### 4. Data Management\n**Description:** Tickets related to data handling and issues within the Core Infrastructure, including data linking and email routing through specific domains.\n**Count/Percentage:** 2 tickets (22.2% of total)\n**Common Keywords/Phrases:** \"Data Lake\", \"Linked candidate profiles\", \"emails are going through\"\n\n### Suggested Improvements to Ticket Categorization:\n1. **Standardize Case Types:** Ensure that each ticket has a 'case_type' assigned to help in filtering and managing tickets more efficiently. Missing 'case_type' data can lead to inconsistencies in handling and prioritization.\n\n2. **Enhance Product Area Tags:** Encourage detailed tagging of the product area to ensure tickets are routed to the correct department quickly. This can reduce resolution time and improve specificity in reporting.\n\n3. **Use of Keywords in Subject Lines:** Implement a guideline for using standardized keywords in ticket subject lines. This can help in automated categorization and quicker identification of the issue type.\n\n4. **Regular Review and Update of Categories:** Periodically review the categories to ensure they still align with the current product features and common issues. This helps in keeping the support process aligned with user needs and product evolution.\n\n5. **Training on Descriptive Ticket Submission:** Train users and support staff on how to submit tickets with clear, descriptive information. This includes using specific subject lines, detailed descriptions of the issue, and relevant screenshots or logs.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, the support team can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their ticket handling processes."
