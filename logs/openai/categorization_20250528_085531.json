Talent Acquisition Features**\n   - **Description:** Tickets in this category are related to features or issues specifically within the Talent Acquisition product area, including workflow automation, event management, and candidate sharing.\n   - **Count/Percentage:** 5 tickets (55.6% of total)\n   - **Common Keywords:** \"workflow automation\", \"Archived events\", \"Bulk Share Candidates\", \"open communities\"\n\n**3. Core Infrastructure Issues**\n   - **Description:** This category includes tickets that deal with core infrastructure issues such as problems with data lakes or email infrastructure.\n   - **Count/Percentage:** 2 tickets (22.2% of total)\n   - **Common Keywords:** \"Data Lake\", \"email issue\", \"vssend.com\"\n\n**4.

This helps in quickly identifying the nature of the ticket (Support Request, Bug Report, Feature Request, etc.).\n\n2. **Enhance Product Area Tagging:** Encourage detailed tagging of the 'product_area' for every ticket. This will aid in routing the ticket to the correct department and in analysis.\n\n3. **Use of Keywords in Subjects:** Implement a guideline for using specific keywords in the subject line that can automatically help in categorizing the ticket into one of the predefined categories.\n\n4. **Automated Tagging with AI:** Consider using an AI tool to read and automatically tag tickets based on content and keywords. This would reduce manual categorization errors and improve efficiency.\n\n5. **Regular Review and Feedback:** Regularly review the categorization process and make adjustments based on feedback from the support team and ticket trends. This will help in keeping the categorization relevant and useful.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, the support team can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of handling and resolving tickets, leading to better customer satisfaction and streamlined operations."
