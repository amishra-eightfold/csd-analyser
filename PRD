   a. Token Management and Data Processing
      - Smart chunking of large datasets:
        * Automatic segmentation of data into optimal token-sized chunks
        * Preservation of context across chunks
        * Priority-based data selection when approaching token limits
      - Token usage optimization:
        * Dynamic calculation of token counts before API calls
        * Intelligent truncation of less critical data
        * Compression of repetitive information
      - Batch processing strategy:
        * Sequential processing of data chunks
        * Aggregation of insights across multiple API calls
        * Progress tracking for multi-chunk analysis

   b. Data Completeness Assurance
      - Validation mechanisms:
        * Pre-processing data verification
        * Post-processing completeness checks
        * Missing data detection and handling
      - Fallback strategies:
        * Automatic retry mechanism for failed API calls
        * Alternative processing paths for oversized data
        * Graceful degradation when token limits are reached
      - Quality control:
        * Consistency checks across processed chunks
        * Validation of merged analysis results
        * Detection of potential data gaps

   c. Error Handling and Recovery
      - Token limit management:
        * Proactive monitoring of token usage
        * Dynamic adjustment of chunk sizes
        * Automatic cost optimization
      - Error recovery:
        * Automatic retry with reduced chunk size
        * Intelligent resumption of interrupted analysis
